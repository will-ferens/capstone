# Shelf Life
ðŸ“š


Shelf Life is an iOS reading list app that allows users to keep track of the books they want to read, find new books with a built in barcode scanner, and view recommended books based on the items in your list.

Using an unfamiliar tech stack, Swift, and coding environment in Xcode, I created Shelf Life in a ten day time frame, learning and building on the fly.

Shelf Life utilizes a Realm Mobile Database in SQLite, Core Data to persist user's information, Google Books to power the search functionality, and Amazon to provide the recommendations feature.
